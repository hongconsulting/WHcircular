Description: This package re-implements circular-linear regression and other 
    selected functionality from the 'circular' package for improved performance, 
    particularly by avoiding construction of O(n^2) diagonal matrices. 
    Additional functions are provided for time-of-day variables in "HH:MM" 
    format. 'WH' code is designed to maximise speed, for use in simulation 
    studies. As such, input validation is minimal and the user is responsible 
    for ensuring valid use.
